Create a function that accepts a single variable and returns a promise.
Within the function use a setTimeout (500ms) that checks if the number is greater than 10.
If itâ€™s true the promise resolves and returns true, otherwise it rejects (fails) and returns a string with an error.
Execute it:
  - Using promise chainable API;
  - Using async / await;
Print to the console when it is done
